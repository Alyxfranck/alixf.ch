In 2024, my *Matura* thesis, titled **Binary Melodies**, set out to explore how randomness can transform text into visual art. The project is both a technical and artistic endeavor that delves into the world of algorithmic art, using Swiss song lyrics as a base for generating images through custom code. Here’s a look into the process and inspiration behind this digital art project.

## Project Background

My thesis is part of a larger art initiative that includes:
- **Randomness in Art**: A study of randomness in art history, featuring pioneers like Manfred Mohr, Roman Verostko, and Manuel Barbadillo.
- **Image Generation from Text**: The core component where text is converted to binary code, then transformed into images via Bézier curves.
- **Binary Melodies Website**: The website [binarymelodies.com](https://binarymelodies.com), showcasing the project’s art.
- **NFT Collection**: Proceeds from NFT sales benefit Passepartout Biel/Bienne, a local social organization.

## Visual Encryption Process

The main research question was: *How can randomness be used to turn text into visual art?* Using Java, I wrote a series of programs that transformed binary-encoded text into Bézier curve-based images. Three versions of the program bring different visual qualities to life:

1. **Grayscale**: A monochrome version highlighting curve shapes and structures.
2. **RGB**: A vibrant, colorful version using RGB values derived from the binary data.
3. **Distributed**: Adds randomness to curve placement, producing more dynamic compositions.

## The Role of Chance

Randomness here is more than a technique; it’s an artistic choice. Each output is unique, shaped by the interplay between structured code and random variables. By adjusting probability, random seeds, and coordinates, each program creates an organic and unpredictable image.

## Blockchain and NFTs

To broaden the project’s reach, I created an NFT collection, with each song represented in Grayscale, RGB, and Distributed versions, resulting in 30 pieces. All proceeds from these digital artworks support Passepartout Biel/Bienne.

## Looking Ahead

Generative art is evolving as technologies like AI and machine learning expand what’s possible. My thesis contributes to this field, showing how randomness can create meaningful and aesthetically rich digital art from text. The interplay of code and chance transforms song lyrics into visual compositions, offering a glimpse into the future of algorithmic art.
