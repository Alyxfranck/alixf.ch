Creating **Buillt Docs** has been a unique and personal journey for me. What started as an idea to solve a familiar problem—messy, unorganized document collaboration—has grown into a full-fledged project that I’m incredibly passionate about. The goal of Buillt Docs is simple: to make real-time collaboration easier, faster, and more intuitive for teams. But the journey to get here has been anything but simple.

## Why I Built Buillt Docs

Like many developers, I’ve dealt with the frustrations of trying to collaborate on documents with others. Version control becomes a nightmare, and even with cloud-based solutions, the process often felt fragmented. I wanted to build something that could streamline this process—an app that would let users **edit documents together in real time**, with no lag and no confusion about who’s editing what. That’s when **Buillt Docs** was born.

## Liveblocks: The Magic Behind Real-Time Collaboration

To make Buillt Docs truly live, we turned to **Liveblocks**, a technology designed for real-time collaborative experiences. It’s what powers the **live text editing** and **presence indicators** in Buillt Docs, ensuring that teams can work together as though they were in the same room, even if they’re miles apart.

What drew me to Liveblocks was its ability to make something so complex—real-time synchronization—look and feel seamless. The first time I saw live cursors moving across the screen as we edited a document together, I knew we were onto something special.

## The Journey of Building Buillt Docs

Building Buillt Docs hasn’t been without its challenges. As we’re still in the process of developing both the **site** and the **app**, we’re constantly learning and improving. From fine-tuning the user experience to ironing out synchronization issues, every step has been a lesson in **app design and development**.

This project is deeply personal for me. It’s not just about solving a problem I’ve faced; it’s about **creating something that I believe will make collaboration better for everyone**. Every day brings new challenges, but also new solutions, and that’s what makes this journey so rewarding.

## Looking Ahead

Right now, Buillt Docs is still a work in progress, but I’m excited about what’s to come. As we continue developing it, I’m confident that Buillt Docs will become a tool that teams everywhere can rely on to collaborate effortlessly. This project represents our team’s passion for pushing boundaries and building digital tools that truly make a difference.

This journey is far from over, but I can’t wait to share Buillt Docs with the world.
