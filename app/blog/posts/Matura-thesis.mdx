summary: 'The intersection of algorithmic art and randomness, where Swiss song lyrics are converted into unique visual art forms using code. This thesis examines the role of randomness in digital art and its potential for creating aesthetic expressions. Also considering the mathematical aspect of randomness and the difference between physical and computional randomness.'

In 2023, my *Matura* thesis, titled **Binary Melodies: Algorithmic Visual Encryption**, set out to explore how randomness can transform text into visual art, and act as a form of pseudo Encryption. The project is both a technical and artistic endeavor that delves into the world of algorithmic art, using Swiss song lyrics as a base for generating images through code. Here’s a look into the process and inspiration behind this project.


## Project Background

My thesis is part of a larger art initiative that includes:
- **Randomness in Art**: A study of randomness in art history, featuring pioneers like Manfred Mohr, Roman Verostko, and Manuel Barbadillo.
- **Randomness as a Mathematical concept**: Understanding the math behind the randomness in the physical world and computer generated randomness. 
- **Image Generation from Text**: The core component where text is converted to binary code, then transformed into images via Bézier curves.

## Visual Encryption Process

The main research question was: *How can randomness be used to turn text into visual art?* Using a Java dialect, I wrote a series of programs that transformed binary-encoded text into Bézier curve-based images. Three versions of the program bring different visual qualities:

1. **Grayscale**: A monochrome version highlighting curve shapes and structures.
2. **RGB**: A vibrant, colorful version using RGB values derived from the binary data.
3. **Distributed**: Adds randomness to curve placement, producing more dynamic compositions.

## The Role of Chance

Randomness here is more than a technique; it’s an artistic choice. Each output is unique, shaped by the Randomseed value and the binary input. By adjusting probability, random seeds, and coordinates, each program creates an organic and unpredictable image.

## Blockchain and NFTs

To broaden the project’s reach, I created an NFT collection, with each song represented in Grayscale, RGB, and Distributed versions, resulting in 30 pieces. All proceeds from these digital artworks support Passepartout Biel/Bienne.

## Looking Ahead

Generative art is evolving as technologies like AI and machine learning expand what’s possible. My thesis is contarsting to this recent development in technology, as it uses Primitive approaches and simple alogrithms to output digital art from text. The interplay of code and chance transforms song lyrics into visual compositions, offering a glimpse into the past of algorithmic art.
