        Hello, Iam Alix Franck
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
       Iâ€™m a developer and tech enthusiast, combining creative problem-solving with efficiency. As co-founder of Buillt.ch and Swiss Founders Lab, I modernize websites and implement innovative business ideas with modern technology.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Recent projects include a 3D visualization using live data and the development of Buillt Docs, a real-time collaborative editing tool. Whether I'm coding or building apps, dark mode is a must for me, as it keeps me focused during long sessions while minimizing eye strain.
